# Assignment 02

* Implement a interface that allow us to test the transformations over a triangular mesh:
  - Translation
  - Scale
  - Shear
  - Rotation around a point
  - Rotation around a arbitrary axis
  - Non-uniform scale
  - Animate the mesh using time as input (translation, rotation, etc.)

* Render several models
  - Each with a different transformation
  - Implement a scene manager
  - class ModelManager
  - Store  the models and meshes
  - class Model
  - Mesh ID + Transformation
  - class Mesh
  - Mesh
